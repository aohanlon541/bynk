## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

## Assumption

### Styling

I kept the styling of the form generally consistent with what you would find on Bynk's website

### Redux

I chose to not use redux in this project, simply because I haven't spent enough time with Redux to quickly use it. If given the opportunity at Bynk, I would spend a lot of time studying up on Redux and practicing.

### Libraries

I avoided using libraries and doing most things by hand (except react-select, I _really_ wanted a search feature on the select inupt) so I could show my aptitude.
